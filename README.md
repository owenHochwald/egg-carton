# 🥚 Egg Carton

**"Crack the code, not the security."**

Egg Carton is a serverless secret management proxy built for the era of autonomous AI agents. It eliminates the need for plain-text `.env` files by providing a hardened, encrypted "shell" for API keys, injecting them into agentic workflows (like Claude Code) only at the moment of execution.

Modern AI agents require high-level access to various APIs. Storing these keys locally or in shell history is a massive security risk. Egg Carton solves this by acting as a **Zero-Trust Middleman** between your local machine and the cloud.
